=head1 SYNOPSIS

    name => 'thing-doer',
    dir => '/var/run',
    workers => 8,

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Manager> is the object created L<Proc::tored::Pool/pool>. It extends
L<Proc::tored::Manager>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 workers

Specifies the size of the pool of forked processes. Processes are forked as
needed and used only once.

=cut

has workers => (
  is  => 'ro',
  isa => PosInt,
  required => 1,
);

=head2 on_assignment

A code ref that is called when a task has been submitted to the worker pool.
Receives the manager instance and the task id if submitted.
to L</assign>.

=cut

has on_assignment => (
  is  => 'ro',
  isa => Maybe[CodeRef],
);

=head2 on_success

A code ref that is triggered when a task's result has been collected. Receives
the manager instance, the task id (if submitted), and any return value(s) from
the submitted code block. If no values were returned from the code block, the
results will be an empty list.

  Proc::tored::Manager->new(
    ...
    on_success => sub {
      my ($me, $id, @results) = @_;
      if (@results) {
        ...
      }
    },
  );

If the code ref passed to L</assign> performs an C<exec>, the results array
will be replaced with zero-but-true when the worker process exits with a zero
exit status. This is to (attempt to) avoid confusion in code where an assigned
task may or may not C<exec>.

  on_success => sub {
    my ($me, $id, @results) = @_;

    # Task exited cleanly but without a return value
    if (@results == 1 && $results->[0]) {
      ...
    }
  }

=cut

has on_success => (
  is  => 'ro',
  isa => Maybe[CodeRef],
);

=head2 on_failure

A code ref that is triggered when a task died during execution or exited
abnormally. Receives the manager instance, the task id (if submitted), and the
error message.

=cut

has on_failure => (
  is  => 'ro',
  isa => Maybe[CodeRef],
);

=head2 pending

Returns the number of tasks that have been submitted but whose results have not
yet been collected.

=cut

has pending => (
  is  => 'ro',
  isa => Int,
  default => 0,
  init_arg => undef,
);

    }
  });

=head2 assign

Submits a task (a C<CODE> ref) to the worker pool, optionally accepting a task
id (something string-like).

=cut

sub assign {
  my $self = shift;
  my $code = shift;

  push @_, sub {
    try   { [1, $code->(@_)] }
    catch { [0, $_] };

  $self->forkmgr->start_child(@_);
  $self->forkmgr->wait_children; # triggers pending callbacks w/o blocking
  return 1;
}

=head2 sync

Blocks until all submitted tasks have completed and their results have been
collected.

=cut

sub sync {
  my $self = shift;
  $self->forkmgr->wait_all_children;
}

after service => sub { shift->sync };
